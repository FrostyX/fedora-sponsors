# Fedora Packager Sponsors

https://docs.pagure.org/fedora-sponsors

A static page displaying list of all current Fedora packager
sponsors.

## Features

- Displaying all sponsors
- Displaying sponsors divided into groups based on some criteria
  - Areas of interests / expertise
  - Native languages
  - Regions around the globe
  - Timezones


## What if I am a sponsor

If you are a Fedora packager sponsor, please make sure to configure
your areas of interests and your native languages. There are two
possible ways to do it, choose whichever you prefer.

In this repository, there are [interests.yaml][interests] and
[languages.yaml][languages] configuration files. Both use the same
format, e.g.

```yaml
- id: german
- id: swedish
- id: czech
```


### A) Use the upstream config

Find groups in the config that you would like to assign yourself to
and do it in the following fashion

```yaml
- id: czech
  users:
  - msuchy
  - frostyx
```


### B) Your personal config on fedorapeople.org

Every Fedora user has an access to their own web hosting on
http://fedorapeople.org . For more information, please read the
[official documentation][fedorapeople-docs].

Connect to your fedorapeople hosting and create the following file

```
$ ssh <USER>@fedorapeople.org
$ vim public_html/sponsor.yaml
```

Mine would look like this

```yaml
interests:
- modularity
- web
- command-line

languages:
- czech
```

The list items are ID keys from the [interests.yaml][interests] and
[languages.yaml][languages] files.

Please don't be concerned if you don't see your configuration
immediately propagated into the production instance. It is a
statically generated site, so your configuration will be used during
the next rebuild.


## Development

```
