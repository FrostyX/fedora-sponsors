  <h1>Sponsors</h1>
  <p>
    Packager Sponsors are maintainers that have a good record of
    maintaining packages, doing reviews and assisting others with
    the processes and procedures of Fedora. Sponsors act as mentors
    for new contributors to help point them to areas they would like
    to contribute, assist them with processes and procedures and
    assist them when they need general guidance.
